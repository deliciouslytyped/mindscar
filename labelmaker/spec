stateful sheets:
  state db
    each sheet has an id printed on to it the first time, this is how you keep track of what label areas are already occupied
    how to detect sheet id?
      prompt/cli and have an option for use last sheet

    each sheet has a label schema describing the layout

  label types
    id label
      human readable id
        .R#####-
        the dash is so you can see that the human readable part terminated properly, the . is a kludge spacer so its not on the border
        five digits should be enough for everyone
        R is the series (last one was D for documnt, those are done manually and not a global namespace), r is for..i forgot
        same id should go in the data matrix, but with some kind of url schema to facilitate app lookups and crap?
      data matrix code
        with same id but only the numbers/schema
    sha label
      .SHA256-
      a label for the secure hash of the scanned file
      the format is the lower case hex encoded version (todo does it fit?)

protocol
  principles:
    digital plus paper backup
    mistakes are made, maintain history

  there are three databases, the label state database, the blob store index, and the digital storage provenance db

  print id labels, update label db
  place an id label on the transparency
  scan the document, place in blob store under corresponding id
  update blob store index
  create hash label, update label db
  place hash label on the transparency
  when a series if full, place series start and end on binder, print blob index for binder, and store with binder, along with two usb drives of different models 
    (one is stored in a separate location) containing scan backups (todo research long term archival) and index backups, with zfs filesystems (read only datasets? - create a snapshot)
  update the provenance db and set reminders to check data integrity in x years

 

  if an id needs to be split, mark as obsolete but dont damage or hide the old codes
  labels go in the top left
  labels are obsoleted top down (add new label below old one)
  a new zfs snapshot is created on the digital storage and synced to the second drive
  the catalog is marked to point to the new id

  todo: modify protocol for syncing secondary drives from laptop monrepo?

=================
ask to enter sheet number or use last page,
  error if sheet known full

=================
do like books, do like contracts
put labels on the outer corner
